**Problem Statement**

We are given 2 Jugs of fix volume(in units) and an unlimited supply of Water, we have to get some specific fixed quantity of water in one/both of these jugs by pouring water from one jug to another rules are - 
- While pouring the water you have to pour till the pouring jug is completely empty or the jug on which we are pouring is completly filled.
- You can pour out all the water into soil to empty the jug. 
- The Jugs have no markings and is of irregular shape so you cannot guess quantity unless jug is filled or enmpty.
- You have infinite water supply hence you can take and throw water as much as you like.

Example -  

Suppose you are given two Jugs Measuring **5 ltr** and **3 ltr**  
Both Jugs are empty at the starting hence initial quantity - **0 ltr** & **0 ltr**  
We want 4 ltr of Water to be measured out by using the jugs hence, Final Quantity - **4 ltr** & **0 ltr**  

**Solution to the problem**

We have to retrieve a measured  Quantity of 4 units Water using Jugs of size Capacity 3 ltr and 5 ltr

Size of the 2 Jugs - 5 ltr & 3 ltr

Initial Quantity of Jugs - 0 ltr & 0 ltr  
Final Quantity of Jugs - 4 ltr & 0 ltr
